//This algorithm looks at a group of alphabetically ordered letters and determines which letter is missing
/*
Step 1: Declare my variables. I create an array of the entire alphabet for reference, and an array for the string I need to investigate.
Step 2: Input screening. I need to get rid of the exception cases where no letters are missing before I begin checking the others.
Step 3: Create a reference variable. The range won't always start at 'a', so I need to know which index to start at in 'alphabet' each time
Step 4: Start the loop. Look through the 'range' and break the loop whenever there is a letter gone, and return whichever letter is at 
that index in 'alphabet'
