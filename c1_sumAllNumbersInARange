//The goal here is to sum all the numbers in a range given by 'arr'
//The numbers aren't necessarily in ascending order, so we have to sort them in ascending order first to make the algorithm simpler
//Then we set the counter to start at the 1st number in the range and to end at the last number in the range
//The counter's current value in the loop is added to the result variable and returned after the loop terminates
