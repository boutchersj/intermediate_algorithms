//The goal of this challenge was to make a constructor function to create a Person
//The catch was you can only have 6 keys (the 6 methods), and you must not be able to access properties without the methods
//So you had to make sure the scope of the properties was the methods
//Apparently variables don't count as keys as long as you don't declare them with 'this.' syntax
